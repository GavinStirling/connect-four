# connect-four

Here is my version of Connect 4 which I built as part of the _Nology course.

The goal for this project is to demonstrate my understanding and competence when working with HTML, SCSS and Javascript.

The brief was to develop a working game and have the game be able to reset without refreshing the page.

The game can be found on Github Pages here: https://gavinstirling.github.io/connect-four/!
